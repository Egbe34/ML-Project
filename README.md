## Introduction
A stroke is a medical emergency where blood flow to the brain is interrupted, causing brain cells to die due to lack of oxygen and nutrients. Itâ€™s a leading cause of death and disability worldwide but is often preventable and treatable with prompt action. Every minute a stroke goes untreated, ~1.9 million brain cells die.

Immediate action can save lives and reduce long-term disability. Awareness of symptoms and risk factors is critical.

## Datasets Used

We use 1 file with raw data.
 *  **Stroke data (healthcare-dataset):** Demographics like age, gender, hypertension,... of clients.

A Metadata(dictionary) is provided to help us understand the content of the columns in each file and guide us through the analysis

* **id:** Every client's unique ID.
* **gendr:** Specifies the client's gender.
* **age:** Indicates the age of the client.
* **hypertension:** High blood pressure (Yes/No)
* **heart_disease:** Issue with heart (Yes/No)
* **ever_married:** Marital status (Yes/No)
* **work\_type:** Employment status (Private/Self-employed/Govt\_job/children/Never\_worked).
* **Residence_type:** Living area (Urban/Rural).
* **avg\_glucose\_level:** Average glucose level in blood.
* **bmi:** Body Mass Index.
* **smoking_status:** Smoking status (never smoked/formerly smoked/Unknown/smokes)
* **stroke:** Stroke status (True/False)


**Comments on the Data:**
Looks clean, some missing data can be filled or removed to neglect immpact on the analysis

##  Business Problem & Hypothesis
Predict stroke based on patient's health metrics to prevent risk

* **Question:** 
* **Conclusion:**  

_*Business recommendation*_: 
  * This model can be used by hospitals and telehealth providers to screen patients quickly for stroke risk based on health metrics.
  * Helps prioritize care and perform early intervention in emergency.
  * Potential to integrate into electronic medical record (EMR) systems for real-time alerts.

## Methodology

Our methodology involved several key steps, focusing on data preprocessing, ML-Model selection, Model training , Model evaluation, and tuning

**1. Data preprocessing:** 
* Datasets were downloaded from kaggle.
* Data Cleaning: 
    * maping categorical values to numerical, drop "id" column, not considering gender "Other"
    * fillna bmi with average value-> other approach ??
    * reduce some outliers on age , gender, bmi
   

**2. EDA**
* generic EDA on following columns:
  * Age: Older patients have a significantly higher risk.
  * Hypertension & Heart Disease: Strong positive correlation with stroke.
  * Glucose Level & BMI: Higher values may indicate risk but with some variability.
  * Smoking Status: Formerly smoked and smokes groups show increased risk.   
* power transformer on all numerical columns or glucose level for observing the distribution
* Check relationship with target column "stroke": heatmap for nummerical, chi test for categorical 

**3. Model selection:** 
* KNN 
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest

**4. Model training:**  
* Trained train_dataset and predict test ones for every model
for classification

**5. Model evaluation:** 
Evaluate metrics for classification (target is category)
* Accuracy
* Recall
* Prediction
* F1
-> Focus on F1 due to imbalanced in target "stroke"
-> Best performing model Logistic Regression

**6. Model tuning:**
Grid search vs Random Search

**7. Insights:**
* Older adults with medical conditions should be prioritized.
* Lifestyle factors matter â€” smoking still plays a role.
* Medical metrics like glucose and BMI are useful but work best when combined with age or disease.
* Tree-based models performed best and are interpretable.

## Data Analysis Tools and Libraries:**
* __Python__: The primary programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
* __Pandas__: Essential for data loading, cleaning, and transformation.
* __Matplotlib / Seaborn__: Used for creating various visualizations (bar charts, line graphs).
